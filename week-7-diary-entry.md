**Advantage**
As a patient needing surgery, the new advancements of medical robots has been a huge help. It has lowered the chances of complications post-surgery and has increased preciseness. With human surgeons there wads a lot of room for error but now I don't have to worry about that as much especially since they keep improving the robots more and more each year.

**Disadvantage**
As a doctor, these medical robots have been making it harder and harder to find employment. I can do surgery as well as any of these robots, however, I can have a personal connection with my patients. But with so many medical robots these days it is had to have credibility as a surgeon.

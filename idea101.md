# Medical Robots

All over the country, new technologies in medicine have become more and more popular. One example of this medical robots. The robots are specifically for minimally-invasive procedures due to their preciseness. They will also make cost, recovery time and operation time faster and cheaper.  To use one, scientists have the option to either use computer controls, which means the surgeon doesnâ€™t necessarily have to be present, or by remote.

The very first medical robot was created by Dr. James McEwen, Geof Auchinleck (UBC engineering and physics grad), and Dr. Brian Day in 1985 in Vancouver. This robot was controlled by voice command and was able to lift and move a patient's leg. By the late 80s and early 90s, more and more universities and hospitals were creating, using and researching medical assisting robots.

The company SRI International and Intuitive Surgical created the robot most commonly used in these surgical procedures. The robot is called the Da Vinci Surgical System and computer motion. The Da Vinci is the most common medical robot used today. It has preformed hundreds of surgeries and most times creating a cheaper and more precise surgery. There have been a few instances, however where a simple surgery had complications due to computer error whereas if a human doctor would have preformed the procedure, it wouldn't have been a problem. But everyday there are more and more advances to the medical robot where in the future, it might be the smartest and most reliable option for surgery.

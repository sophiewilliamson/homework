# Week 4 Homework
**Wearable augmented reality- Google Glass**
In 2014, the Google Glass was released. The Google Glass was able to display computer information as well as take pictures and videos through the glasses. In 2015, an app was created that went along with the glasses that allowed them to be worn during hospital visits to eliminate electronic health record problems. The glasses could also be worn by journalists to allow their audience to see what they see when reporting the news. However, the Google Glass was criticized for invading people's privacy due to being filmed without permission.

**Driverless Cars**
A company called Waymo, funded by Google was founded in 2010 to creating the first driverless cars. They spent years experimenting with the car taking drives on public roads with police escorts or a passenger, however, in 2015, the first
completely driverless trip was taken on a public road without police escorts or passengers. The prototype had no steering wheel, gas/break pedals. In 2017 they started the trails for a self driving taxi service.

**Drones**
In recent years, drones have become more and more popular.  They have mostly been used for deliveries, photographs and videos. companies like Amazon still considering using them for a delivery service for their products. A program called Drones for Good in Dubai is focused on growing the use of drones to better society. For example, they produced a drone that can detect poachers. Another one can act as surveillance for the police.

**Robot Surgeons**
There has been new advances in the medicine industry; Surgeons are now being trained to use robots called the Da Vinci as a tool in surgery. Over 5 million of these robots have been used. However, the robots aren't always accurate and can't be relied on to not make any mistakes. There are pros as well such as the fact that the robot can make deeper and more microscopic cuts as opposed to large ones that happens during regular surgeries.

**Advanced CGI**
The CGI animating in the movie Paddington, for example, is done with advanced computer technology. First, videos are taken of a setting for a specific scene using a stand-in for the character. Then, animators go in and animate over top of the stand-in, making the final video look like a CGI character is in the scene with the people.

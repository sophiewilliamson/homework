For my project I wanted to make a satirical ad/poster design either hand drawn or done in illustrator. The image would depict a robot hand holding a human heart, but it would be holding it tightly to show people's discomfort with their life being in the hands of technology. The top of the image would have a slogan promoting the Da Vinci robot. The image is a rough sketch of the layout of the poster.
